# Title
 “Synopser - Text Summarization”

# Problem Statement / Opportunity
   The amount of data produced every day is mind-boggling. There is a problem of searching for relevent documents from the number of available documents 
   and absorbing    information   from it and it is very easy to get distracted and lose focus. Many times the available data is unstructured and the best
   we can do is read through several pages of the blog/e-book/article and then reach a conclusion about its effectiveness. With ever growing digit media, 
   it's time consuming to go through entire blog/e-book/article and decide whether it is useful or not.

# Project Description
  Aim of our project  is to build Deep learning based solution that generates an Abstractive Text summary of content available in Textbox of our webapp 
  entered by user. User can customize the length of summary using horizontal bar designed in webapp. After successfully submitting text data , user will
  get summarize data in output box. 
  Now user can copy the Summary using the ‘Copy Text & Speak’ button and after that, the selected summary is spoken by our implemented speak feature.
